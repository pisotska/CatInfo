        Welcome to my home. I am super cat <strong>Karat</strong>. A beautiful
        paddle-eared Scotsman. A native of Lviv. I love myself, fresh air, food
        and sleep. I dream of running away from home and living in a dump with
        my worthless dog-friend Jack. When I grow up, I will have my own cat
        food factory. I am currently meeting people for my future business
        plans. <p>Let's make love! Let's get to know each other!</p>
